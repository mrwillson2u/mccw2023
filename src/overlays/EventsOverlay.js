        We’re celebrating Maddie’s country farm roots by having a tailgate party! 
        There will be a variety of fun games on the lawn for people to connect 
        with new and old friends. Some of the games that will be played include 
        cornhole, ladder toss, and horseshoes. The party starts at noon and goes 
        until dark, so come on out and enjoy some good food, fun, and fellowship!

        We cordially invite you to join us for our exchange of vows, to be held on

        our love and commitment to each other.
